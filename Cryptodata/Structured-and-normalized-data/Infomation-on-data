The data is structured in the following matter:
Each row for any dataset here is suppose to be considerd as a 22 dimensional vector.

The first dimension is the diference between the highest High and the lowest Low of the trading time steps of the following 20 dimensions.
This dimension has been normalized to zero mean and one unit variance using all the values that fall inside the first column.

The 2nd to the 21st dimension are the opening, low or high of the trading value of each time step in 20 consecutive trading time steps.
Each one of these values has been normalized to zero mean and one unit variance using all the values from the 2nd to the 21st dimension.
e.j. days 01/01/2017 to 01/20/2017

The 22nd dimension is the value of the following time step from the previous 20 dimensions.
Using the mean and the variance of the previous 20 days this value is normalized.
This values is our Y in the training algorithim.
e.j. days 01/21/2017
